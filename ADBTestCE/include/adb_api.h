/** \brief Handle to an API object.

  To access USB interface and its components clients must first obtain a
  handle to the required object. API Objects that are represented by a
  handle are:
  1. Interface enumerator that provides access to a list of interfaces that
     match certain criterias that were specified when interface enumerator
     has been created. This handle is created in AdbEnumInterfaces routine.
  2. Interface that is the major object this API deals with. In Windows
     model of the USB stack each USB device (that is physical device,
     attached to a USB port) exposes one or more interfaces that become the
     major entities through which that device gets accessed. Each of these
     interfaces are represented as Windows Device Objects on the USB stack.
     So, to this extent, at least as this API is concerned, terms "interface"
     and "device" are interchangeable, since each interface is represented by
     a device object on the Windows USB stack. This handle is created in
     either AdbCreateInterface or AdbCreateInterfaceByName routines.
  3. Endpoint object (also called a pipe) represents an endpoint on interface
     through which all I/O operations are performed. This handle is created in
     one of these routines: AdbOpenEndpoint, AdbOpenDefaultBulkReadEndpoint,
     or AdbOpenDefaultBulkWriteEndpoint.
  4. I/O completion object that tracks completion information of asynchronous
     I/O performed on an endpoint. When an endpoint object gets opened through
     this API it is opened for asynchronous (or overlapped) I/O. And each time
     an asynchronous I/O is performed by this API an I/O completion object is
     created to track the result of that I/O when it gets completed. Clients
     of the API can then use a handle to I/O completion object to query for
     the status and result of asynchronous I/O as well as wait for this I/O
     completion. This handle is created in one of these routines:
     AdbReadEndpointAsync, or AdbWriteEndpointAsync.
  After object is no longer needed by the client, its handle must be closed
  using AdbCloseHandle routine.
